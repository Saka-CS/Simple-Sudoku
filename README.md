# Simple-Sudoku
A simple game of sudoku intended to run in an online compilers or in a terminal.

# Play
Originally the objective was to make the game run on any online compiler but it seems that many of them don't support colors, though thankfully this site seems to run it just fine https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler. Or alternatively you can simply run it localy.
