# Simple-Sudoku
A simple game of sudoku intended to run on an online compiler.

Originally the objective was to make the game run on any compiler but it seems that many of them don't support colors, but thankfully this site seems to run it just fine https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_compiler.
